# TMUCSA Website Project

## Overview
This is the website for TMUCSA, a social club that promotes student wellbeing through various activities at TMU.

## Information
Next.js has server sided rendering, backend, and frontend capabilities. Next.js is built on React.js, so you can utilize React packages. It allows an easier way of routing without `react-router-dom`. Simply put, it's easier learning Next.js than React.
> Next.js routes work in the `src/app/` directory. Basically if you want to go to a different part of the website, like `tmucsa-website/about`, create a directory called `about` and create a `page.js` file that renders in the HTML. It's that simple. For more information on how it works, check out the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
